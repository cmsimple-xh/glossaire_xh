      <h2 id="top_page">I - Description</h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Glossaire_XH</span> can display a
        definition on mouse over of certain words in your articles and also in
        newsboxes. This definition may be titled and illustrated.</p>
      <p>Once configuration validate one first time for the template in used,
        simply go to the admin and record a first word and its definition.</p>
      <p>When reading one of your articles, if the word is present in the text,
        it will display the definition on mouseover, as would a tooltip.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This word appears highlighted with a dotted line (configurable)</li>
        <li>Number of occurrences is configurable (allowing a definition of the
          first appearance of the word only, for example)</li>
        <li>The aspect of the definition displayed is configurable for each
          template.</li>
        <li>Work on multilingual site.</li>
        <li>Recognition of plural (for supported languages).<br />
          <br />
          The intervention on the text takes place at the level of the content
          variable and just before the display of the article. Word lists (one
          per language) and the associated definitions are stored in text format
          in the data folder of the plugin.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>II -languages</h2>
      <p>The plugin can work in all languages supported by CMSimple_XH,</p>
      <p>its plural detector (let the words created to be recognized when they
        are plural in the article) currently supports the following languages:
        Cs, Da, De, Fr, It, Nl, Ru, Sk.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Danish :
          Create the word in its indefinite form. Therefore, the plural detector
          will find its definite form and the plurals (definite and indefinite).
          Example for a car = bil, the words bilen, biler, bilerne will be also
          detected.<br />
          <br />
          Slovak and Czech : Create the word in its nominative form (basic). The
          plural detector will try to find other forms and their plural.<br />
          Only the names are concerned, and all cases are not provided.<br />
        </span> </p>
      <p>The administration is available in the following languages (default
        English):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">French</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">English</span> (personal
          translation, tell me the errors that may be present)</li>
        <li><b>German</b> - translation and german help file provided by <a target="_blank"

            href="https://cmsimplexh.de">Michael Zajusch</a></li>
        <li><b>Slovak</b> - translation provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmsimpleforum.com">Tata</a></li>
        <li><b>Czech</b> - translation provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://oldnema.compsys.cz/en/?Demo_templates">Oldnema</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>To add a new language to this plugin, it requires two conditions :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate the language file.<em></em> </li>
        <li>That I add the plural recognition for the language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you wish to use this plugin in a language other than those already
        proposed, contact me. You can propose me your own translation of
        language file, thank you.</p>
      <h3>2.1 - Use in multilingual site</h3>
      <p>Glossaire_XH respects the philosophy of CMSimple_XH. The plugin
        interface appears in the language in use (according to the languages
        supported by the plugin, if not in English) and the words and
        definitions created are placed in a specific folder of the data folder
        of the plugin. If your site includes for example two languages, English
        and German, the words created in English and their definitions are
        therefore placed in data/en/ of plugin. For German, it will be data/de/.</p>
      <h2>III - Installation</h2>
      <p>Transfer the contents of the zip to the root of your site (same level
        than plugins/ folder).</p>
      <p>Pay attention to the limitations of your host. OVH, for example,
        folders must have a = chmod 705 and files 604 (the most permissive for
        files and scripts being 755). This field must be populated with the
        number "<span style="font-weight: bold;">705</span>" in the case of OVH.</p>
      <p>Check this with your FTP software (eg FileZilla).</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To use the plugin</span>,
        simply validate a first configuration (Configuration page) for the
        template used. The template.htm file of your template will be modified
        by adding <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">init_Glossaire()</span><span

          style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>. A copy of the
        original file will be performed (template.htm.bak).</p>
      <p>According to the limitations of your host, the operation may not be
        possible; In this case you will be prompted to perform this add manually
        by editing the template.htm file of your template. Add the code bellow
        before the echo of content() :</p>
      <pre>&lt;?php init_Glossaire(); ?&gt;</pre>
      <p>For convenience of automation, the plugin add this code just after the
        end tag &lt;/head&gt;.</p>
      <p>It is possible to disable the plugin for a template (Configuration
        page). When active, a check box is provided for deactivation.</p>
      <h3>3.1 - Updates</h3>
      <p>Glossaire_XH is compatible with <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">updatecheck</span>
        plugin (by <a target="_blank" title="updatecheck" href="http://CMSimple.HolgerIrmler.de">Holger
          Irmler</a>) which allows to indicate to the webmaster if updates are
        available for installed plugins on the site or for the CMS itself.</p>
      <h2>IV - Configuration</h2>
      <p>This page allows you for each template to : </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable the plugin on your site</span>
          (underlined words and definitions overview).<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate the plugin for the
            newsboxes</span>.<br />
          If you want the plugin also works in the text of your newsboxes.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure the number of occurrences
            to be replaced in article</span>.<br />
          Enter a number (eg 1 if you want only the first occurrence of the word
          appearing in the article is "defined"). If you want all instances be
          treated, enter <span style="font-weight: bold;">-1</span> (minus sign
          followed by a number, no spaces) [do not put anything else in this
          field]<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Determine the display width of the
            definition. </span>For a long definition (do not forget that the
          definitions are added at the end of articles, in source), the default
          width of the display appear insufficient, the displayed frame
          stretching too high. <br />
          <br />
          Two widths are configurable : The first "default" is the width that
          will be applied to all definitions displayed. 20em normally be fine
          but you can change this value.<br />
          <br />
          Why "em" and not "px" : em is a relative unit that allows resizing
          text. The definition display and maintain its proportions if the
          visitor changes the text size displayed by the browser. The second
          value set at 30em default (you can change it) will be the width of
          only some definitions provided to check the option at the time of
          publishing them.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Determine the aspect of the
            occurrence in the article</span>. The word will be underlined with a
          solid line, dashed or dotted lines that you can choose the color.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Determine the aspect of the
            definition displayed</span>. An preview of the aspect of the
          definition allows you to view the choices made immediately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> You'll notice the option to choose a template other than the default.
        In this case, the page is reloaded with the selected template, allowing
        you to more easily compare with the definition preview of the right side
        form (this preview directly shows the settings in the ASPECT part of the
        configuration). Once the form is validated, the template is still
        selected and displayed unless you choose another or choose another page.<br />
        <br />
        Important: As long as the configuration template has not been validated,
        the plugin is not working for your visitors. </p>
      <p>Tip: Make rather short definitions, whatever the field.</p>
      <h2>V - Words and Definitions</h2>
      <p>This page allows you to manage the list of words and definitions
        related thereto.</p>
      <h3>5.1 - The list of words</h3>
      <p>It displays existing words, access to their editing or creation of a
        word and its definition, it also allows to simply delete a word and its
        definition.</p>
      <h4>5.1.1 - The filter</h4>
      <p>Comes in the form of an alphabetical list.<br />
        If you click on a letter of the filter, the table will be filtered
        according to the letter and classified in alphabetical order according
        to the words column.<br />
      </p>
      <h4>5.1.2 - Sorting</h4>
      <p>Each column heading in the table(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Id</span>,
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Words</span>) has a link sorting. You
        can sort the table according to the column of your choice, the title
        will be highlighted. (Sort alphabetically but abbreviations will be
        placed first). The dimensions of the table are fixed. When the number of
        words will be sufficient to exceed the height of the table, you will can
        browse the list of lines with the mouse wheel or by using the scrallbar
        to the right. The use of the filter so will reduce the number of rows
        displayed.</p>
      <h4>5.1.3 - The list</h4>
      <p>The list has one column for the id and one for the words. Simply click
        on a word line to access the edit page (same page than for creation). A
        check box located at the end of each line is used to select one or more
        words for delete. Then, a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span>"
        button appears at the bottom of the table, with an indication of the
        number of selections. Delete a word causes the deletion of its
        definition.</p>
      <h3>5.2 - Create word and definition</h3>
      <p>At the bottom of the list, click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Create
          a word</span>".</p>
      <p>You are now on the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">WORD and
          DEFINITION</span>" page where you'll write the word, the title of the
        definition (optional)*, and the definition itself.</p>
      <p>Regarding the title, this is the title of the definition displayed
        area. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">*To not have a title
          area, just leave the field blank.</span></p>
      <p>An ID is displayed at the top for page. This is the number identifying
        the word and its definition, it is not editable.</p>
      <p>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">WORD </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;">
          TITLE</span> fields, do not put HTML code or other. Fill in the fields
        with your keyboard without using <span style="font-style: italic;">copy/paste</span>
        for example. This is important especially for accents.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: The
          research to be carried out in the article is not "case sensitive".
          However, for abbreviations (eg A.B.C.D. or ABCD) and only in this
          case, the search will ONLY on capital (a.b.c.d. will not be found or
          abcd)</span>.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DEFINITION</span> : The editor
        (depending on the choice made in the admin of CMSimple_XH) allows you to
        create the definition. You can place an image (note the definition that
        will be displayed is not very wide, so use a small image if it will be
        truncated).</p>
      <p>The colors (titles and texts and their backgrounds), font, border
        colors are configurable in Aspect part of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration</span>
        page.</p>
      <p>Down just before the submit button, a check box allows to expand the
        width of displayed definition.</p>
      <p>Another option allows you to set the comportment of displayed
        definition during its mouseover. If checked, the definition will stay
        freeze after cursor mouseover its content. A close button is added in
        its upper right corner (It will also close if another definition is
        displayed). Without this option, the definition closes as soon as the
        cursor is not over.<br />
        This can be useful if the text contains several links, for example.</p>
      <p>Once the form is filled, click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>"
        at the bottom.</p>
      <p>You are now back to the list of words and appears in this one the word
        you just created.</p>
      <h3>5.3 - Sound and video</h3>
      <p>First, it must be borne in mind that if a word is defined in the
        article posted, the definition is necessarily in the flow of the page
        (in the end). It is of course obvious that if the word in question is
        flown but it is there. In case you want to insert an audio or video
        player, the following problems arise:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to start playing automatically.</li>
        <li>How to stop it when the definition closing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The script glossary can drive a player if it can be controlled by
        javascript. It automatically calls two functions, one for playing when
        the definition appears, another stop it when the definition is closed.
        You will need to create a javascript file named<span style="font-weight: bold;">
          fonct_util.js</span> and that you put in the js folder of the plugin
        (plugins/glossaire/js/). It should contain the following functions must
        be adapted to the player used:<br />
        <br />
        For playback : <b>demLect(id)</b><br />
        To stop : <b>stopLect(id)<br />
        </b><br />
        where<span style="font-weight: bold;"> id</span> is the id of the player
        object tag . It will add an id to your object tag player as follows:
        vidgpop + the id number of the word to which the definition (the id is
        at the top of the form creation/editing of the word) .<br />
        <br />
        For example, the definition of id n°<b>35</b>, the id will be &lt;object
        id="vidgpop<b>35</b>"...</p>
      <h4>5.3.1 - Concrete Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Reader's Choice</span>
          (or 'players')<br />
          These flash players. The advantage is that they will find server side
          (on your site, so) and they will be displayed on almost all
          configurations. It is, for video <span style="font-weight: bold;">flv
            player</span> :<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="http://flv-player.net/players/maxi/preview/">http://flv-player.net/players/maxi/preview/</a>
          and for audio, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flash mp3 player</span>
          :<br />
          <a target="_blank" href="http://flash-mp3-player.net/fr/players/maxi/">http://flash-mp3-player.net/fr/players/maxi/</a>
          Both are well documented and are by the same author which is an
          advantage because the javascript commands are the same.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>2)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Installation Files</span><br />
          Download the players and place them in the folder userfiles/media/.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Create the file
            fonct_util.js</span><br />
          You can use an editor for this but a simple text file created using
          Windows Notepad enough.<br />
          Right click, new, text document, open it and copy/paste the following
          code:
          <pre class="brush:js;">function demLect(id){<br />var elt= document.getElementById(id);<br />if (elt != null) elt.SetVariable("player:jsPlay", "");<br />}<br />function stopLect(id){<br />var elt= document.getElementById(id);<br />if (elt != null) elt.SetVariable("player:jsStop", "");<br />}</pre>
          <br />
          Save the file and rename it<span style="font-weight: bold;">
            fonct_util.js</span><br />
          Finally, load it in the js folder of Glossaire_XH (in
          plugins/glossaire/js/)<br />
          <br />
          The script of the glossary will be responsible for recognizing the
          presence of the file and use the functions demLect and stopLect when
          the time comes.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insert the video
            player in a definition</span>.<br />
          For example, a word whose id is <span style="font-weight: bold;">43</span>
          (this id appears in the list of words). A video file .flv will be
          included in its definition. The video file is named video.flv (in this
          example), place it in the folder userfiles/media/. To create flv
          files, there are free converters. Here is an example:<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Free FLV Converter</span> on <a target="_blank"

href="http://www.koyotesoft.com/">http://www.koyotesoft.com/</a><br />
          <br />
          Code inserted in the definition, id <span style="font-weight: bold;">vidgpop43</span>
          is added :
          <pre>&lt;object id="vidgpop43" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="userfiles/media/player_flv_maxi.swf" width="320" height="240"&gt;<br /> &lt;param name="movie" value="userfiles/media/player_flv_maxi.swf" /&gt;<br /> &lt;param name="FlashVars" value="flv=video.flv" /&gt;<br /> &lt;/object&gt; </pre>
          <br />
          Paths can be relative to the root of the site, as above. The path of
          the flv file, meanwhile, is relative to the location of the player.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the case of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">multilingual
              site</span></span>: When it is not the primary language of the
          site, add <span style="font-weight: bold;">../</span> before
          userfiles/ like this:<br />
          <pre>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">../</span>userfiles/media/player_flv_maxi.swf"</pre>
          <br />
          Important reminder : For inclusion in a definition must be added to
          the object tag an id equal to the id of the word in question (here
          vidgpop43). This is the id that will be targeted by demLect and
          stopLect functions.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>5)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Insert the mp3 player</span><br />
          Place the mp3 file into the folder userfiles/media/ (and the reader if
          it is not already). Same method as for the video file, sample code
          inserted in the definition of the word with id <span style="font-weight: bold;">45</span>
          (mp3 file of the example is called eagles.mp3) and where the id given
          to the object tag becomes <span style="font-weight: bold;">vidgpop45</span>:
          <pre class="brush:php;">&lt;object id="vidgpop45" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="userfiles/media/player_mp3_maxi.swf" width="200" height="20"&gt;<br /> &lt;param name="movie" value="userfiles/media/player_mp3_maxi.swf" /&gt;<br /> &lt;param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=eagles.mp3" /&gt;<br /> &lt;/object&gt;</pre>
          Finally, the option to can freeze a definition can be checked (at the
          bottom of the create/edit page of a word) for the insertion of an
          audio/video player. The close button which then appears at the top
          right of the definition, also will stop the playback.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>VI - Printing</h2>
      <p>When printing an article, every word remains highlighted and defined
        with a link to its definition placed at end of article (underline does
        not necessarily appear in the preview used depending on the css of
        template). The definitions thus accumulated are preceded by a title "<span

style="font-weight: bold;">Glossary</span>". If printing is done to a
        pdf, the links remain active and link to each relevant definition
        (anchor).</p>
      <p>Note : An article also includes its glossary of defined words when
        printing. The number of printed pages will depend on the length of the
        article but also that of its definitions. The advantage of using short
        definitions takes on its meaning.</p>
      <p>The definitions are nevertheless displayed in two columns and a smaller
        font size.</p>
      <h2>VII - Uninstall</h2>
      <p>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration</span> page, disable
        the plugin for each template in the list.</p>
      <p>This means delete <span style="font-weight: bold;">init_Glossaire()</span>
        in the <span style="font-style: italic;">template.htm</span> file of
        each template.</p>
      <p>Then delete all the plugin files, this means removing the "<span style="font-style: italic;">glossaire</span>"
        folder: plugins/glossaire/</p><h2>VIII - Download</h2>
