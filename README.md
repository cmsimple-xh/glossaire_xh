Hello everyone
For health reasons, I stop the development of the "Glossaire_XH" plugin. It will therefore no longer be available on my site.

If someone is interested in continuing it (respecting the license) and perhaps bring it up to date, I can provide information if necessary.
It is enough to contact me (via MP or via the contact form of my site).

In any case, I am happy that Glossaire_XH could have been useful for a few during these few years and I want a long life at CMSIMPLE_XH as well as to this forum.

Wear yourself well and good luck.
Ludovic
